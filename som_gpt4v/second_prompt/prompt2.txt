In this task, we are required to sweep paper balls into a dustpan using a brush.
Since the only object manipulated by the robotic arm is the brush, with its most important part being the bristles (marked as number 1), it's essential to retain number 1.
Numbers 5 and 7 represent the handle of the brush, which is smaller and does not need to interact with the paper balls.
Number 10 is a minor corner of the brush and is not significant.
Numbers 6, 8, and 9 belong to the paper balls and only need to move with the brush, so they are not necessary to keep.
