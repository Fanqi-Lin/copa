In this task, we are required to insert books into a white bookshelf, necessitating the retention of some key numbers on both the books and the shelf.
Numbers 11, 12, and 13 are parts of a book, with number 11 being the book's large, prominent side, which we will retain.
Numbers 9 and 14, representing the table surface, will be discarded.
Numbers 5 and 8 are parts of a cup, irrelevant to the task, and thus discarded.
Numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 are on the white bookshelf, where we will retain the clearer and more noticeable bottom surface 4 and side surface 1.
